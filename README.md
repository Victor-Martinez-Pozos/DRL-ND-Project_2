# DRL-ND-Project_2

## Description

In this project I trained a SAC agent to solve the unity environment "Reacher" which consist in a Double-jointed arm which must move to target diferent locations, and the states and actions consists as follows:

* Vector Observation space: 26 variables corresponding to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the two arm rigid bodies.
* Vector Action space: (Continuous) Size of 4, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints.
* Visual Observations: None
